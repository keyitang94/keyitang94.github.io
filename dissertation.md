Research on distributive politics has focused separately on domestic politicians favoring partisan supporters or financing sources constraining regional favoritism via external accountability mechanisms. This book provides a novel perspective by jointly analyzing how financier accountability and domestic political competition interact to shape the subnational distribution of foreign development projects. I argue that regional distribution is most biased when lax financier oversight combines with intense electoral pressures, favoring coethnic/partisan strongholds and swing voters. Integrating original electoral data across 519 regions in 48 African countries (1995-2021) with geocoded Chinese and World Bank projects, and tracing road project allocation in Ethiopia, Zambia, and Ghana case studies through 175 interviews, focus groups, and original administrative data, this multi-method study offers a new explanation for the redistributive effects of international finance by considering both domestic and foreign incentives. It also contributes fresh evidence on political competition and patronage.
