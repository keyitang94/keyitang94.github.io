Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Boston University [Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I will join the [ESADE Business School](https://www.esade.edu/en) in Barcelona as a tenure-track assistant professor in international relations/global governance in Fall 2024. I received my Ph.D. with distinction at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies [(SAIS)](https://sais.jhu.edu/) in June 2023.

My research focuses on the international and comparative political economy of development, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa and China. Broadly speaking, I am interested in three topics: (1) the impacts of China's global economic strategy in the Global South; (2) the institutional causes of resource misallocation; (3) the structural transformation of the Global South.

My scholarly work has been featured in academic journals such as the _Review of International Political Economy_ and _Energy Policy_, as well as in media outlets like _The China-Global South Project_, and _South China Morning Post_. Part of my book project won the 2024 Best Graduate Student Paper Award from the International Political Economy Section of the International Studies Association. 


Before my Ph.D. training, I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) with a B.A. in English in 2016 and obtained my M.A. in International Studies from the [Hopkins-Nanjing Center](https://sais.jhu.edu/hopkins-nanjing-center) in 2019.
