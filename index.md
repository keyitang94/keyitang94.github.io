Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in international relations/global governance at the [ESADE Business School](https://www.esade.edu/faculty/keyi.tang) in Barcelona. I received my Ph.D. with distinction at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies [(SAIS)](https://sais.jhu.edu/) in June 2023. From 2022 to 2024, I was a Research Fellow at the Boston University [Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/), and from 2018 to 2022, I was a Research Affiliate at the China Africa Research Initiative [(CARI)](https://www.sais-cari.org/).

My research focuses on the international and comparative political economy of development, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa and China. Broadly speaking, I am an expert on three topics: (1) the impacts of China's global economic strategy in the Global South; (2) the institutional causes of resource misallocation; (3) the structural transformation of the Global South.

My first book, [_Power Over Progress: How Politics Shape Development Finance in Africa_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/power-over-progress/CEE618F7A939B99982A750C0B2EDF9C0), is forthcoming at _Cambridge University Press_. Part of this project won the 2024 Best Graduate Student Paper Award from the International Political Economy Section of the International Studies Association. My other scholarly work has been featured in leading academic journals such as the [_Review of International Political Economy_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09692290.2022.2152073), [_Energy Economics_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988325001768), and [_Energy Policy_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421519306494), as well as in media outlets like _The China-Global South Project_, and _South China Morning Post_. 


Before my Ph.D. training, I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) with a B.A. in English in 2016 and obtained my M.A. in International Studies from the [Hopkins-Nanjing Center](https://sais.jhu.edu/hopkins-nanjing-center) in 2019.
