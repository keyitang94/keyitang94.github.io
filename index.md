Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies [(SAIS)](https://sais.jhu.edu/), a Research Affiliate at the Boston University [Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/), and an Oskar Morgenstern fellow at the George Mason University [Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org/).

My research focuses on the political economy of development, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Broadly speaking, I am interested in three topics: (1) the impacts of development finance on the service delivery of weak institutions; (2) the long-term impacts of political favoritism on inclusive development; (3) the structural transformation of the Global South.

Before coming to SAIS, I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/) with a B.A. in English in 2016 and obtained my M.A. in International Studies from the [Hopkins-Nanjing Center](https://sais.jhu.edu/hopkins-nanjing-center) in 2019.
